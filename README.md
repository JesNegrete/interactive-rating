## My process
For this project i started by analyzing the design, i took note of how many cointainers and buttons
i would need. I knew that i would have to create a continer for the rating and the rating results, i wasn't sure
how to go about it so i used google and i found a lot of helpful resources that i will name later. By analyzing the design first 
I'm able to organzie my code in a way that makes styling the page easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned how to use JavaScript to add and remove the hidden attribute, this allowed me to 
make the page interactive.

### Continued development
Im defenitley going to continue working on more projects that require the use of the hidden attribute and JavaScript.
